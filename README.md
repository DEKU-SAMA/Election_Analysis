# Election_Analysis
Overview of Project
This weeks challenge helps us build upon our skills learned in the python module. For deliverables, the client wanted additional information analyzed from the election 
results. To complete the audit, for loops, conditional statements with memberships and logical operators were used to investigate parameters such as percentage vote by 
county, voter and county turnout. To concluded the summary, a text file was generated to record the findings.

Results:
In this congressional election, there were 369,711 votes that were cast. Provided below are the counties with the largest number of votes in decending order:

Denver: 306,055 votes(82.8%)
Jefferson: 38,855 votes (10.5%)
Arapahoe: 24,801 votes (6.7%)

The following list is a breakdown of the number of votes and their respective percentage of the total votes each candidate recieved. The canidate that won was Diana 
DeGette and the runners up in decending order by total votes are shown below:

Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes
Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 votes
Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes (3.1%)

Summarry:
Given how this code is supposed to function, its puposes can be used for any elections, large or quaint. It would be an interesting parameter to see the geographical 
location of each person who voted and create a heat map. This will give valuable information of where to do more outreaching to get a more wholistic representation of 
the local population. The limitations of this dataset are that they only limit a few parameters. It would also be interesting to see the age groups and genders that 
participated in the election so that the parties can go about better strategizing for target audiences they struggled to reach with their platforms and policies.
